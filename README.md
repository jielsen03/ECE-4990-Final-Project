# ECE-4990-Final-Project
This project implements a real-time facial emotion detection system using a Raspberry Pi, PiCamera2, OpenCV, and the FER deep-learning model. The system captures live video frames, detects faces, classifies emotions, and overlays confidence scores directly onto the video stream. It serves as a complete implementation testbed for embedded emotion recognition.
